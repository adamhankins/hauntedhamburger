        <div id="game description" class="message"><p>You have been hired by the
            owner of the
            Haunted Hamburger to go on a mission to retrieve something very 
            valuable: the Magic Spatula. It is cooking utensil like no other: 
            it has the power to bring hamburgers to life--literally! The former
            management of the Haunted Hamburger accidently spawned something
            horrendous inside the restaurant, and now it is too dangerous for 
            them to go back inside. Instead, they have hired you for the dangerous
            mission and you need the money too badly to back down from the
            challenge!<br><br>
            
            Your instructions: Find the Magic Spatula and leave the restaurant
            as soon as you get it. The owner has told you that as soon as you're
            outside the restaurant with the spatula, anything inside will no 
            longer have any power.<br><br>
            
            Use two word commands such as "look tree" or "get chainsaw" to control
            your character. Click on the directional keypad to move around the 
            Haunted Hamburger.<br><br>
            
            Good luck!</p><br>
